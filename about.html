        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I have been coding for just over a year now. Throughout my life I've
          jumped in and out of coding doing very small projects with the likes
          of CodeCademy. After flying back from Canada due to Covid.<br />
          I decided to focus on myself and work on starting a career in tech. I
          am trained in Comptia A+, N+ and Security+
        </p>
        <p>I have also created a few projects which you can see below.</p>
